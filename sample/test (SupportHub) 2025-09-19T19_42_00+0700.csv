More details: Hi Wayfair,
We found that the customer has purchased our product on November 18, 2024, the PO number is CS558981339. We also found he made a replacement on January 27, 2025, and we had already dealt with it. It has been more than half a year since then. But now he makes a new order for the same product, the PO number is CS610935345. We'd like to know if there are any other after-sales problems with the original order, or he just wants to purchase another one. If there are any other issues with the original order, please tell us what the problem is.
Thanks for your help.

Hello, regarding the issue with CS603712922, I have already communicated with you before. You informed me that the Wayfair backend display is normal and will not affect my performance. However, on August 25th, a replacement order CS606556030 was generated in the backend and I have already shipped it. This means that due to the system error, I sent two same items to the same recipient. I hope you can handle it as soon as possible.
